I worked on this project as a part of Distributed Systems Course I did in my university.

About Project: A group messenger chat application is developed for android. When a user sends some text messages, they are received in FIFO order by recipients. Total ordering of messages is also enforced, When multiple users send broadcast messages in parallel, everyone receives all messages in same order.

Algorithms Used: For Total Order I implemented ISIS algorithm. This implementation of algorithm works with crash stop devices.
